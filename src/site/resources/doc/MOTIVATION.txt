Why logic2j?
------------

I was seeking for a solution to implement business rules within an enterprise IT software architecture.
Following a detailed study and evaluation of the market, including Drools, ILOG JRules, and other approaches,
I came up with limited number of use cases. Unfortunately they would defeat the classic memory objects + DSL approach 
put forward by the RETE and forward-chaining inference engines.

I have a previous experience in functional programming and first-order predicate logic, including Prolog. Thus,
it occured to me that a backward-chaining demonstration engine, coupled with powerful template / pattern subsitution would
provide more power to implement a business rules engine targeting heterogeneous IT platforms and data sources.

I sought for an open-source inference engine in Java, with strong ties to the JDK that would (i) provide a simple API
to invoke predicate logic from Java, and (ii) allow Java-implementated predicates to be called back by the engine.
Quite expectedly I found several implementations of Prolog, since it is both a language and a programming platform / environment.

tuProlog was clearly fitting my requirements and the adoption was fast.

Over time however, a number of limitations appeared, which weren't trivial to workaround. Among them:
- memory footprint and management of data structures make it difficult to handle large data sets
- non-shared memory approach does not allow easy extension of the Term API (copying happens very often and is difficult to track)
- API to retrieve or manipulate solutions is cumbersome
- codebase lacking best patterns and java generics

Logic2j started as a challenge and proof-of-concept for a more state-of-the-art implementation of a 
Prolog inference engine, and never aimed to become a full Prolog programming environment. 
The striking differences over tuProlog are:

- an Inversion-of-Control approach to relay solutions removes the need to keep state for backtracking
- a shared-memory approach guarantees full extensibility and eases debugging (any structure is original and immutable - no copies)
- the performance is overall improved, and large solution sets can be generated without footprint since they are enumerated
- a much reduced codebase, fully generic and Java1.6 syntax, more modern coding patterns
- the API to retrieve or manipulate solutions is more flexible



Features in more details:
- Custom Java predicates (primitives) can generate an indefinite number of solutions. 
  This does not need complex bactracking, content from any collection or iterator can be "pushed" to the inference engine easily.

- The codebase aims at or uses state-of-the-art programming patterns such as:
  Inversion of Control
  Factory / Interface / Implementation
  Hooks and derivation points to extend functionality
  Separation of concerns (unification, inference, parsing, formatting, term hierarchy)
  Visitor design pattern
  Ease of use integration DI framworks (eg Spring)

- Java 1.5+ language and JRE features fully leveraged
  Generics
  Varargs
  Forall and Iterable
  Static imports
  (closures still very expected to come...)
