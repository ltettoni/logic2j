Why logic2j?

I was seeking for a solution to implement business rules within an enterprise IT software architecture.
Following a detailed study and evaluation of the market, including Drools, ILOG JRules, and other approaches,
I came up with limited number of use cases. Unfortunately they would defeat the classic memory objects + DSL approach 
put forward by the RETE and forward-chaining inference engines.

I have a previous experience in functional programming and first-order predicate logic, including Prolog. Thus,
it occured to me that a backward-chaining demonstration engine, coupled with powerful template / pattern subsitution would
provide more power to implement a business rules engine targeting heterogeneous IT platforms and data sources.

I sought for an open-source inference engine in Java, with strong ties to the JDK that would (i) provide a simple API
to invoke predicate logic from Java, and (ii) allow Java-implementated predicates to be called back by the engine.
Quite expectedly I found several implementations of Prolog, since it is both a language and a programming platform / environment.

tuProlog was clearly fitting my requirements and the adoption was fast.

Over time however, a number of limitations appeared, which weren't trivial to workaround. Among them:
- memory footprint and management of data structures make it difficult to handle large data sets
- non-shared memory approach does not allow easy extension of the Term API
- API to retrieve or manipulate solutions is cumbersome
- codebase lacking best patterns and java generics

Logic2j started as an challenge and proof-of-concept for a more state-of-the-art implementation of a 
Prolog inference engine, and never aimed to become a Prolog programming environment. 
The striking differences over tuProlog are:

- an Inversion-of-Control approach to relay solutions removes the need to keep state for backtracking
- a shared-memory approach guarantees full extensibility and eases debugging (any structure is original and immutable - no copies)
- the performance is overall improved, and result sets of virtually infinite length can be generated without footprint
- a much reduced codebase, fully generic and Java1.6 syntax, more modern coding patterns
- the API to retrieve or manipulate solutions is more flexible
