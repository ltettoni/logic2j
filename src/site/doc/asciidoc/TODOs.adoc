====================

To investigate further
----------------------

* Using Java assertions (but check for recommended / best practices carefully first - and document them), they do not replace exceptions.
* Refactor unit test cases to leverage new JUnit's bundle of hamcrest v1.3
* There is no Tail Recursion Optimization (TRO) yet
* Have a look at Java CDI (JSR ?, JSR 250, instead of Spring) for easier integration with CDI frameworks (see tasks in PrologImpl)
* Implement Prolog predicates setof, bagof, etc. See http://www.csupomona.edu/~jrfisher/www/prolog_tutorial/4.html
* How could we leverage multi-core architectures? Running "queens(11, _)" shows that only one core is busy.


* assertions and/or DbC?
