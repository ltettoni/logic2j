Features to load tabular data into logic2j.
Instead of working directly with Excel, I assume here that all data can reside in memory and defined a serializable object
"TabularData" that interacts with logic2j as a ClauseProvider.
The loading Excel is just a matter of massaging cells into a TabularData instance.
