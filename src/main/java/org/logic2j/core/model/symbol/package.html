Package model.symbol contains the Term hierarchy of classes, plus the TermApi helper class.
The Term hierarchy is an API to the syntactic aspect of the Prolog formalism.

Logic2j uses a particular implementation design for a Prolog engine, named "shared structures".
This means that Term graphs are immutable and do not store actual values (results) of bindings.
As a consequence, Terms cannot be directly used for unification or solving, since they are devoid
of values. Yet they may be shared by recursive solving, unification, and by multiple threads.

Separate structures are used to hold values of terms, see subpackage "var".
