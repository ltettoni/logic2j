<p>
Package api.solver.listener defines the callback mechanism (Iversion of Control design pattern) between the Prolog
engine and the calling code. Solutions are "sent" from the engine to user code through the SolutionListener interface
and various implementations are provided.

<p>
This is the lowest level for obtaining solutions, but not necessarily the most convenient to use for programing.
Therefore higher-level utilities are also provided to obtain solution and extract useful information from them.
First, have a look at IterableSolutionListener.
Then, see also the SolutionHolder API.
