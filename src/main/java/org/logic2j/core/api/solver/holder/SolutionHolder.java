/**
 * Holds state necessary to describe the unique solution or multiple solutions to a goal; this object lies between the expression of a goal
 * (a request or query) and the extraction of any aspect of the solution (existence of a solution, number of a solutions, values of a given
 * binding, or values of all bindings or results). <br/>
 * IMPORTANT: This is a lazy proxy to solutions: obtaining a {@link SolutionHolder} does not imply that the execution has yet started -
 * state is held ready to execute, until you tell it what you need! <br/>
 * This object exposes strongly-typed, templated methods to extract results depending on how the calling code expects them (unique or
 * multiple solutions), and the type of data needed (just the number, resolved-term solutions or single variable bindings).<br/>
 * Depending on the case, the actual calculation of the goal may be performed immediately (then results are stored and returned as needed),
 * or delayed until access methods are called.
 *
 * TODO Maybe have a way to allow limiting "all" to a reasonable number.
 *
 * <p/>
 * This type of API for extracting results from a data layer should further be analyzed and confronted to other APIs such as JDBC, JNDI,
 * SAX/DOM, or more exotic ones such as JSon (MongoDB/Apache CouchDB), Neo4j and Prot�g�. Also RDF frameworks APIs may be considered.
