Package org.logic2j.core.api.solver.holder is part of the solver's fluent API to hold intermediate state
before a "terminal" method triggers the exection of the Solver.

GoalHolder is returned by the main solver's solve() method. It allows to decide what need to be solved:
        - existence or not of a solution
        - number of solutions
        - extraction of the solutions(s) to the specified goal
        - extraction of a single variable from the specified goal
        - extraction of all variables

SolutionHolder further allows all cases of extraction above to specifiy the
        - cardinality (single-value or multi-valued)
        - obligation (optional, mandatory result, at-least or at-most values)
        - modality (iterable or all-in-memory)
        - storage (List or array)
