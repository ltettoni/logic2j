   logic2j - Bring Logic to your Java
   ==================================

A library to bring declarative & logic programming to your Java software.

Logic2j is designed for first-order predicate formal logic, it includes all necessary
components to manage Terms and their representations, an inference engine solver,
an extensible unification framework, an in-memory or database-backend knowledge base.

This work was triggered by using "tuProlog" from the University of Bologna, Italy, in production projects.
Logic2j is however of a different nature and based on other algorithms in particular for unification and inference.

The design guidelines were: closer integration with the JRE, minimal dependencies,
small footprint, high performance, and state-of-the-art coding patterns.

Although very close to Prolog, logic2j is NOT a complete Prolog programming environment, is not
intended to be compatible with Prolog specification, this is just the core engine...
