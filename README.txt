   logic2j - Bring Logic to your Java
   ==================================

A library to bring declarative and logic programming to your Java software.

It is designed for first-order predicate formal logic, and includes all necessary
components to manage Terms and their representations, an inference engine solver,
an extensible unification framework, an in-memory or database-backend knowledge base.

This work was inspired by "tuProlog" from the University of Bologna, Italy. 
This is a major rewrite with completely different unification and inference algorithms.

The design guidelines were: close integration from and to Java, minimal dependencies, 
open and extendable implementation, small footprint, and high performance.

Although very close to Prolog, this is NOT a Prolog programming environment, is not 
intended to be compatible with Prolog specification, this is just the core engine...
